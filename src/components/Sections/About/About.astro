  <AboutMeDescription>
    <Paragraph class="pb-2">
      Hi! I'm <Keyword dataIndex="0">Matías</Keyword>, a software
      developer who's been fascinated by technology and coding since I was a
      kid. I love creating things that make people's lives easier — clean,
      intuitive, and meaningful.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Outside the screen, I enjoy exploring life as much as code. I love trying
      new <Keyword dataIndex="4">foods</Keyword> and restaurants, spending
      time at the <Keyword dataIndex="2">gym</Keyword>, and sharing
      moments with my <Keyword dataIndex="5,6" multiPhoto>friends</Keyword> — they're a big source of inspiration and good energy.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Family means a lot to me, and I'm grateful for the people who've always
      been there — especially my <Keyword dataIndex="8">girlfriend</Keyword> and my <Keyword dataIndex="9">mom</Keyword>, who've both been
      my biggest supporters through every project and challenge.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I also find joy in <Keyword dataIndex="7">traveling</Keyword> and
      getting lost in the worlds of <Keyword dataIndex="3">videogames</Keyword> — both keep me curious and creative.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      At the end of the day, I'm just me — passionate, grounded, and always
      looking for the next thing to learn or build.
